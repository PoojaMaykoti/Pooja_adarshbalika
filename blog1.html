   <p class="para3">

      I am pooja, from solapur, maharashtra. I am 20 years old. There are 3 members in my family mom and elder brother including me. My father passed away whhen i was 2 years old. So my mother worked hard to run the house herself. She started making bidis to support the household. When i turned 13 years old, I also learnt how to roll a bidi and started rolling it on a regular basis to support my mother. My mother worked hard alone herself to support us both.My mother used to make 1500 bidis in a day to make rupees in a month. I compeleted my class 10th & 12th along with rolling bidis side by side to support the upkeep of my family.I wanted to do BCOM aften my class 12th but i was unable to do because of the finacial constraints in the family. The college fee was 5000 rupees. Learning computer knowledge is my passion so. I completed MSCIT and TallyERP9 course. Neighbour uncle informed me about Swami Hariharanand Industrial Training Institute (SHITI) and its three trade i.e (Computer Operating and Programming Assistant, Electrician, Diesel Mechanic ), Due to my affection towards computer. I select (COPA) This trade includes variety at topics like Networking, JavaScript, 
      HTML, CSS, English, etc. Fromall of the above topics went in programming which includes javascript, HTMl, CSS etc.I like to builds code logically. I heard about neog.camp from my teachers at SHITI. I am very excited to be appling for it. I do hope that i make in to it and start a new chapter in my life getting in to this boot camp would be life changing and i would be very gratefull for this apportunity. ! Cheers

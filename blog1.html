   <!-- <h2 class="heading2">Hi Am Pooja</h2> -->
   <p class="para3">
<!-- 
      I am pooja, from solapur, maharashtra. 
      I am 20 years old. There are 3 members in my family mom and elder brother including me.
       My father passed away whhen i was 2 years old. 
       So my mother worked hard to run the house herself. 
       She started making bidis to support the household. 
       When i turned 13 years old,
        I also learnt how to roll a bidi and started 
        rolling it on a regular basis to support my mother.
      
      
      
      
      My mother worked hard alone herself to support us both.
      My mother used to make 1500 bidis in a day to make rupees in a month.
      
      
      
      I compeleted my class 10th & 12th along with 
      rolling bidis side by side to support the upkeep of my family.
      I wanted to do BCOM aften my class 12th but i was unable to do
       because of the finacial constraints in the family.
      

      
      
      The college fee was 5000 rupees. Learning computer knowledge is my passion so. I completed MSCIT and TallyERP9 course.
       Neighbour uncle informed me about Swami Hariharanand Industrial Training Institute 
       (SHITI) and its three trade i.e (Computer Operating and Programming Assistant,
        Electrician, Diesel Mechanic ), Due to my affection towards computer.





        
       I select (COPA) This trade includes variety at topics like Networking, JavaScript, 
      HTML, CSS, English, etc. Fromall of the above topics went
       in programming which includes javascript, HTMl, CSS etc.
       I like to builds code logically. I heard about neog.camp 
       from my teachers at SHITI. I am very excited to be appling for it.
        I do hope that i make in to it and start a new chapter in my life getting in
         to this boot camp would be life changing and i would be very gratefull for
          this apportunity. ! Cheers    -->




          Hi there.
          I would like to talk about a custom that takes place 
          in my community. I urge you to read this piece till the end.
          






   </p>

<p  class="para3">


   I come from a lower middle class family living 
   in Solapur, Maharashtra. I belong to the telugu
    speaking padmashali samaj. Much like most communities
     in India, it is deeply patriarchal and backwards in 
     its customs and beliefs. Men are seen as  prized princes 
     and women are seen as a burden. Nothing surprising there.
      But one particular custom stands out as particularly 
      shocking and shameful
   , at least to me. 



</p>

<p  class="para3">


   In my community, there is something called ‘pedda manshi’, literally meaning ‘coming of age’ an event that takes place when a girl 
   reaches menarche or the start of periods. Over the following 9 days,
    several mini functions take place. There is a haldi ceremony for the
     first 2 days. Grandparents and and aunts send in food. Seventh day
      onwards the celebration opens up for neighbours, relatives and 
      extended family. Everyone gathers to share meals and the apparent
       good news.




</p>


<p  class="para3">
   On the surface this may seem like a happy event, celebrating a
    thing that is widely considered to be a taboo, but there is 
    a deeper, disturbing truth to it. This function serves as an 
    announcement to the community about their daughter’s fertility 
    status. It is like letting everyone know that our child has now
     reached sexual maturity, she is fit to
    bear children, so that potential matchmaking may begin. 


</p>

<p  class="para3">


   While all this fun and revelry takes place, the girl herself 
   is kept in a curtained room, and is not permitted to talk to
    anyone. Contact with men is forbidden. Food is pushed from 
    under the door, laundry and utensils are to be washed by the 
    girl herself. She is treated like an untouchable, in a word.
     So basically the community’s   merriment takes place at the
      expense of a poor girl’s childhood, freedom, agency. 
   Often the girl is as young as 9 years old, a mere child.
</p>


<p  class="para3">

   There are hundreds of ways in which patriarchy plays out in 
   our daily life and this is one of them. This blog may not
    eradicate the issue but we need to keep talking about it.
    All change starts with a dialogue. Thanks for reading!

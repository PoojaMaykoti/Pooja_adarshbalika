<!-- I would like to talk about a custom that takes place in my community. I urge you to read this piece till the end.
I come from a lower middle class family living in Solapur, Maharashtra. 


I belong to the telugu speaking padmashali samaj. Much like most communities in India, it is deeply patriarchal and backwards in its customs and beliefs. Men are seen as  prized princes and women are seen as a burden. 


<br><br>

Nothing surprising there. But one particular custom stands out as particulary shocking and shameful, at least to me. 
In my community, there is something called ‘pedda manshi’,literally meaning ‘coming of age’ an event that takes place when a girl reaches menarche. Over a 9 day period, several mini functions take place. There is a haldi ceremony for the first 2 days. Grandparents and and aunts send in food. Seventh day onwards the celebration opens up for neighbours, relatives and extended family. Everone gathers to share meals and apparent good news.
<br><br>
On the surface this may seem like a happy event, celebrating a thing that is widely considered to be a taboo, but there is a deeper, disturbing truth to it. This function serves as an announcement to the community about their daughter’s fertility status. It is like letting everyone know that our child has now reached sexual maturity, she is fit to bear children, so that potential matchmaking may begin. 


<br><br>

While all this fun and revelry takes place, the girl herself is kept in a curtained room, and is not permitted to talk to anyone. Contact with men is forbidden. Food is pushed from under the door, laundry and utensils are to be washed by the girl herself. She is treated like an untouchable, in a word.

 My name is Pooja, I am Solapur, Maharashtra. I am 20 years old. 
 There are 3 members in my family mom and elder brother and myself.
  My father passed away when I was 2 years old. So my mother worked 
  hard to run the house herself. She started making bidis to support
   the household. When I turned 13 years old, I also learnt how to 
   roll a bidi and started making it on a regular basis to support 
   my mother.
My mother worked hard alone herself to support us both. She used to
 make 1000 bidis in a day to make 3000 rupees in a month.

  I completed my class 10th & 12th along with rolling doing bidi
   work side by side to support the upkeep of my family. I wanted
    to do BCOM after my class 12th but I was unable to do because 
    of the financial constraints in the family.

  I was always interested in learning about computers so I 
  completed MSCIT and TallyERP9 course. Then my neighbourhood 
  uncle informed about a skilling camp and I joined it. This trade 
  includes variety at topics like Networking, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
   English, etc. From all of the above topics I liked programming the
    most. I like to build code logically. I heard about neog boot camp
     from my teacher. I am very excited to be applying for it. I do hope
      that I make in to it and start a new chapter in my life. Getting
       into this boot camp would be life changing and I would be 
       very grateful for this opportunity. Fingers crossed!

  <h1 class="heading1">Hi There.

I would like to talk about a custom that takes place in my community. I urge you to read this piece till the end.
I come from a lower middle class family living in Solapur, Maharashtra. I belong to the telugu speaking padmashali samaj. Much like most communities in India, it is deeply patriarchal and backwards in its customs and beliefs. Men are seen as  prized princes and women are seen as a burden. Nothing surprising there. But one particular custom stands out as particulary shocking and shameful, at least to me. 
In my community, there is something called ‘pedda manshi’,literally meaning ‘coming of age’ an event that takes place when a girl reaches menarche. Over a 9 day period, several mini functions take place. There is a haldi ceremony for the first 2 days. Grandparents and and aunts send in food. Seventh day onwards the celebration opens up for neighbours, relatives and extended family. Everone gathers to share meals and apparent good news.

On the surface this may seem like a happy event, celebrating a thing that is widely considered to be a taboo, but there is a deeper, disturbing truth to it. This function serves as an announcement to the community about their daughter’s fertility status. It is like letting everyone know that our child has now reached sexual maturity, she is fit to bear children, so that potential matchmaking may begin. 




While all this fun and revelry takes place, the girl herself is kept in a curtained room, and is not permitted to talk to anyone. Contact with men is forbidden. Food is pushed from under the door, laundry and utensils are to be washed by the girl herself. She is treated like an untouchable, in a word.
